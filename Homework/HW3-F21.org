** Thermal ethane dehydrogenation occurs in is plagued by the generation of ``coke,'' or a cake of primarily carbon. An alternative way to create ethylene is through oxidative dehydrogenation:
#+BEGIN_CENTER
\ce{ C2H6 (g) + O2 (g) -> C2H4(g) + H2O (g) }
#+END_CENTER
\noindent At \SI{600}{K} over some catalyst the reaction is half-order in ethane, first-order in \ce{O2}, zero order in products, and has a pseudohomogeneous rate constant of 5.0 $\text{M}^{-1/2}\text{s}^{-1}$. You plan to run the reaction in an isothermal, constant pressure reactor starting with a 20 mole % excess of ethane at \SI{2}{bar} total pressure.

1. Plot the rate of disappearance of \ce{C2H6} and of \ce{O2} vs \ce{C2H6} conversion (don't forget to balance the reaction!).

2. Plot the concentrations (in M) of all species vs residence time in the reactor.  How long will it take for half the ethane to be consumed?
