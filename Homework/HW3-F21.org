\noindent *Carefully and neatly document your answers.  You may use a mathematical solver like Jupyter/iPython. Use plotting software for all plots.*

* Key ideas                                                        :noexport:

* Too hot in here
Thermal ethane dehydrogenation, which you studied in the last homework, occurs at high $T$ and is plagued by the generation of ``coke,'' or a cake of primarily carbon. An alternative way to create ethylene is through oxidative dehydrogenation:
#+BEGIN_CENTER
\ce{ C2H6 (g) + O2 (g) -> C2H4(g) + H2O (g) }
#+END_CENTER
\noindent At \SI{600}{K} over some catalyst the reaction is half-order in ethane, first-order in \ce{O2}, zero order in products, and has a pseudohomogeneous rate constant of 5.0 $\text{M}^{-1/2}\text{s}^{-1}$. (Note, I am completely making this up!) You plan to run the reaction in an isothermal, constant volume reactor starting with an 70:20:10 mixture of \ce{N2}:\ce{C2H6}:\ce{O2} at \SI{2}{bar} total pressure.

** Plot the rate of disappearance of \ce{C2H6} and of \ce{O2} vs \ce{C2H6} conversion (don't forget to balance the reaction!).

** Plot the concentrations of all species vs residence time in the reactor.  

* Not a laughing matter
Nitrous oxide (\ce{N2O}) decomposes to \ce{N2} and \ce{O2} at high temperature. Experiments were performed at constant $T$ in a constant volume batch reactor. You can assume the reaction rate has the form $k P_{\ce{N2O}}^a$.

** What is the reaction order?
** What is the apparent activation energy?

* I'm getting dehydrated
/tert/-butanol can be dehydrated to isobutylene over an ion-exchange resin. An experiment was performed to follow the concentration of butanol vs time at 338 K. You can assume the reaction rate is only dependent on the concentration of /tert/-butanol under these reaction conditions.

** Write down the balanced reaction.

** What is the reaction order?

** What is the rate constant at this temperature?

* Pressure packed
\ce{NH3} synthesis from \ce{N2} and \ce{H2} was studied in a constant volume reactor (0.315 l) over a Ru catalyst, in a clever setup in which the \ce{NH3} was continuously removed from the reactor.  The total pressure in the reactor was followed vs time at three different compositions and at \SI{350}{\celsius}. The pressures are reported as their equivalent values at 298 K (ie $N/V = P/R\times \SI{298}{K}$).

** Write down the balanced reaction.

** Plot the \ce{N2} and \ce{H2} concentrations (mol/vol) vs time for each initial condition.

** Use finite differences to make a table of reaction rates (moles/time/volume) vs composition (mol/vol \ce{N2} and \ce{H2}).

** Use your rate data to determine a rate law and rate constant for the reaction at these conditions.
